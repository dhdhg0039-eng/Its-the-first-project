    "title": "How The Macallan Became a Cult Scotch Whisky",
    "description": "<p>When it comes to spirits, Scotch whisky is on the more expensive end of the spectrum. For the most part, it’s single malts bringing up the price of the whole category, with bottles typically costing far above that of their blended counterparts. But there’s expensive single malt Scotch, and then there’s The Macallan. While the distillery produces a few more affordable bottles — like the Double Cask 12 Year, which one can find for around $70 — the vast majority of its expressions arrive in the over-$200 range.</p>\n<p>The article <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/the-macallan-cult-scotch-story/\">How The Macallan Became a Cult Scotch Whisky</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://vinepair.com\">VinePair</a>.</p>\n",

As one moves south down that mountain range, there is a mountain called Mount Veeder, and it’s right there where one of the most beautiful Cabernet Sauvignons in Napa Valley is made. In fact, it’s the only wine VinePair has ever awarded a 99-point score. It is, of course, Mayacamas Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon.

    "description": "<p>These days, you can’t walk into a brewery taproom without seeing at least one New England IPA on offer. Juicy, bitter, and bursting with tropical fruit flavors, the New England or hazy IPA substyle took off in the mid-2010s and went on to define nearly a decade of craft brewing. Yet, in a world where hazy IPAs can be found in nearly every corner of the country, there’s one that stands out from the pack and has maintained a rabid following: Heady Topper. But what is it that has allowed this beer to achieve its cult-like status?</p>\n<p>The article <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/heady-topper-cult-beer-story/\">How Heady Topper Became a Cult Beer</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://vinepair.com\">VinePair</a>.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Ryan Chetiyawardana is no stranger to the unconventional. The bartender, better known by his moniker Mr Lyan, has used ingredients like koji and beeswax and put industrial microwaves to task, all in the name of making esoteric drinks at his bars across London, Amsterdam, and Washington, D.C. So this month when he opened Seed Library, the first New York City outpost in his lineup of five spots worldwide, it was hardly a surprise that he reimagined a classic cocktail using snails.</p>\n<p>The article <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/seed-library-snail-cocktail/\">Mr Lyan’s First New York Bar Opens With a Bramble Riff Featuring… Snails?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://vinepair.com\">VinePair</a>.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Champagne is undeniably one of the most luxurious wines in the world. Produced with a labor-intensive winemaking practice called méthode Champenoise, all Champagnes undergo a secondary fermentation in bottle, allowing the wine to age on the lees. The result is a rich, complex, and textural sparkling wine that, when paired with the region’s prestige terroir and extensive history, leads to some lofty price tags.</p>\n<p>The article <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/most-expensive-champagnes-2025-map/\">The 10 Most Expensive Champagnes in the World (2025) [MAP]</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://vinepair.com\">VinePair</a>.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Last week, VinePair published an article posing the question of whether or not sommeliers should post the bottles they sold that night on social media. The practice seems to be growing more popular, and there can be arguments made for both sides. Sure, it might seem pretentious to post the baller bottles you were able to sell that night, but it can also show wine lovers the breadth of your cellar. Moreover, what do you expect these sommeliers and wine bars to post, especially considering the fact that all wine looks the same in the glass.</p>\n<p>The article <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/vp-podcast-do-we-need-wine-bottle-shots-on-socia-media/\">The VinePair Podcast: Do We Need More Bottle Shots on Social?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://vinepair.com\">VinePair</a>.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Despite the back-to-office plotting of corporate overlords, some measure of hybrid work has finally been normalized for legions of us worker bees. Even for those forced into a full-time cubicle-land commute — and the productivity theater that goes with it — many folks really are just clocking out earlier. The paradigm had been creeping into pre-pandemic work culture for some time, and the Covid inflection point secured the scenario as the modern modus operandi. The knock-on effect for the hospitality industry?

The global mezcal market is projected to reach around $2.5 billion by 2032; such growth naturally fosters a better understanding of the category.

    "description": "<p>At the crossroads of full-service and fast-food restaurants lives the fast-casual concept. These restaurants sometimes offer a menu, but more often than not, the foundation of their business model is customizable food options made with fresh, high-quality ingredients. Once the food is prepped, consumers can take it to go if they desire, but the atmosphere inside is often nice enough that dining in feels more elevated than it does at a McDonald’s or a Wendy’s. The style of service skyrocketed in popularity during the Great Recession as diners sought out quick, affordable food options that were still healthy and fresh.</p>\n<p>The article <a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/fast-casual-chains-original-locations-map/\">The Original Location of 12 American Fast-Casual Restaurants [MAP]</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://vinepair.com\">VinePair</a>.</p>\n",
